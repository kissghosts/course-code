582303 Network Programming
==========================

Programming Exercise (February 28 - March 11, 2013):


For this exercise there is only a single task but it is somewhat more
demanding than the usual weekly exercise set. This task is intended to
be completed by Monday, March 11, 2013, at latest (see further
information on grading below).

Your task is to write a program that communicates with a TCP-based
server program (service) which has the service name 

UNIX_TL  

and which is running on host

wel-85.cs.Helsinki.FI

Write a program which connects to the UNIX_TL server and follows the
instructions that the UNIX_TL server will send to your program. You
have done with the task, once you get a message

"...  Your program has been ACCEPTED ..."


UNIX_TL server will not give you all instructions at once, so make sure
you ALWAYS read (receive) everything it sends to your program and do not
close any connection prematurely. In addition, note that not everything
is directly given in the instructions, but sometimes you need to deduce
or guess what your program is required to do. Careful inspection of how
UNIX_TL does things should help in many cases.

Please make sure your program can be run autonomously, that is, it
should require no human intervention at run time (e.g., no user input).
All input should be given as command line arguments. Also, all IP
addresses and port numbers should be resolved by the program code.

UNIX_TL will start its execution on Thursday, February 28, 2013, 
at 16:30 o'clock at latest (may start a bit earlier). There will be an
announcement on the course web page once the server is running.

Important!!!:

Your program may get accepted only if it runs on one of the CS
Department computers (the Linux machines at the department) and the home
directory in use is /home/fs/<login name>/ If you don't have an account
on these computers, please contact Markku Kojo (kojo@cs.helsinki.fi). It
is NOT possible to connect to the server outside of the CS Department
network.

If working remotely, use some of the Ukko cluster nodes at the department
(ukko177.hpc.cs.helsinki.fi - ukko179.hpc.cs.helsinki.fi).

When asked, send the pathname for the source code of your program. It
should be relative to your home directory as you will be instructed by
UNIX_TL. In addition, make sure that the source code for your program is
implemented in a SINGLE source code file ONLY (E.g., my_program.c) and
contains no other include's than the standard headers that you need
(no linking of several modules from separate source code files) and
compiles with

cc my_program.c  (OR gcc my_program.c)

Follow this instruction even though, in general, it might not be
reasonable to implement the program in a single source code file
(module).

Instructor (Markku Kojo) will be available for questions and help on
this task in room C216 according to the following schedule:

Fri Mar 1 at 10:30 - 11:00
Mon Mar 4 at 12:15 - 13:00
Tue Mar 5 at 12:15 - 13:00
Wed Mar 6 at 12:15 - 13:00
Fri Mar 8 at 12:15 - 13:00

This task should be completed by March 11, 2013 at 24:00 (EET)
o'clock.

You will gain course points depending on the time and date your
program is accepted as follows:

6 points deadline Mon, March  4, at 24:00 (EET)
5 points deadline Tue, March  5, at 24:00 (EET)
4 points deadline Wed, March  6, at 24:00 (EET)
3 points deadline Thu, March  7, at 24:00 (EET)
2 points deadline Fri, March  8, at 24:00 (EET)
1 point  deadline Mon, March 11, at 24:00 (EET)

Good luck!
